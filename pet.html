          <p>About:</p>
          The Russian blue cat appears to be larger than she is because of her
          extremely dense, soft double coat. She may be a good choice for pet
          parents with allergies because she doesn't shed much and produces
          lower levels of the glycoprotein Fel d 1, a known allergen, than other
          cat breeds. With her triangular-shaped head, the Russian blue is a
          long and slender cat. She is fine-boned with large ears, a broad
          forehead and straight nose, making her a very regal animal. Russian
          blues are known for a natural "smile." In addition to her luxurious
          silvery coat, her most distinct features are her brilliant green eyes.
          Despite being slender, the Russian blue is very strong and muscular,
          although her thick fur often hides her neck and shoulders, giving the
          impression that her frame is more robust. Her long legs allow her to
          run at high speeds.

          <p>Personality:</p>
          The Russian blue is a sweet-tempered, loyal cat who will follow her
          owner everywhere, so don't be surprised if she greets you at the front
          door! While she has a tendency to attach to one pet parent in
          particular, she demonstrates affection with her whole family and
          demands it in return. It's said that Russian blues train their owners
          rather than the owners training them, a legend that's been proven true
          time and again. They are very social creatures but also enjoy alone
          time and will actively seek a quiet, private nook in which to sleep.
          They don't mind too much if you're away at work all day, but they do
          require a lot of playtime when you are home. Russian blues tend to shy
          away from visitors and may hide during large gatherings.

          <p>Living with:</p>
          Russian blue cats are highly intelligent animals and require physical
          and mental stimulation, so it's important to give them access to toys
          at all times. They retain a strong hunting instinct, so a feathered
          fishing pole toy is the perfect plaything. Consider storing these
          types of toys in a cat-proof spot because: (a) your kitty will tear it
          to shreds, and (b) she may eat the feathers and/or the string, neither
          of which are good for her digestive system or overall health. If you
          maintain a good hygiene routine, your Russian blue will require
          minimal grooming and healthcare.
